# Repository Information

The two main folders of this GitHub repository contain the causal DAGs generated in [Towards Automating Causal Discovery in Financial Markets and Beyond](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4679414). 

Please to cite this paper when utilizing the causal DAGs in your work.

## LLM Clustering DAGs
This folder contains DAGs created using the clusters obtained from the LLM clustering method. Each subfolder is named after the respective clusters, containing three essential files: 
- **node.csv:** Includes names and definitions of nodes in the DAG.
- **edge.csv:** Lists the edges present in the DAG.
- **viz.png:** Provides a visualization of the DAG.

## Hierarchical Clustering DAGs
This folder contains DAGs created using the clusters obtained from the hierarchical agglomerative clustering from [Is There a Replication Crisis in Finance?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13249). Each subfolder is named after the respective clusters, containing three essential files: 
- **node.csv:** Includes names and definitions of nodes in the DAG.
- **edge.csv:** Lists the edges present in the DAG.
- **viz.png:** Provides a visualization of the DAG.

To delve into cluster descriptions, consult the "definitions.csv" files within each folder.

For detailed insights into the DAG generation methodology, please refer to the methodology section of the associated academic paper.

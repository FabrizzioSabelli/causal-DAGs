The folder LLM Clustering DAGs contains the causal DAGs generated using the clusters obtained from the LLM clustering method. 

The folder Hierarichal Clustering DAGs contains the causal DAGs generated using the clusters obtained from Hierarichal agglomerative clustering.

The subfolders in both these folders are named after the clusters obtained from each method respectively. The node.csv file contains the names and definitions asociated with the nodes in the DAG, the edge.csv file contains the edges in the DAG and the viz.png file is a visualization of the DAG.

Descriptions for each of the clusters can be found in the definitions.csv files of each folder.

For more information on how these DAGs were generated, please refer to the methodology section of https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4679414.

Please cite this paper as well if you use the causal DAGs.
